you need to:

Create two VMs (VM1 and VM2) from the .vmdk file.

Connect them using a NAT Network in VirtualBox.

Install openssh-server if not already installed (for file transfer using scp).

Share a .txt file from VM1 to VM2.

ðŸ›  Step-by-Step Guide:
Part 1: Setup VirtualBox and NAT Network
1. Create a NAT Network
Open VirtualBox.

Go to File > Tools > Network Manager (or File > Preferences > Network).

Click Create to make a new NAT Network:

Name: NATNetwork

Enable DHCP.

Don't check "IPv6".

Save and close.

Part 2: Create Two VMs (VM1 and VM2)
2. Create VM1
Click New in VirtualBox.

Name: VM1

Type: Linux, Version: Ubuntu (64-bit).

Memory: Set 2048 MB RAM (2 GB) or as you like.

When it asks for Hard Disk:

Choose Use an existing virtual hard disk file.

Browse and select ubuntu-18.04-amd64-disk001.vmdk (the file your sir shared).

Click Create.

3. Create VM2
Similarly, click New.

Name: VM2

Type: Linux, Version: Ubuntu (64-bit).

Memory: 2048 MB RAM.

When asked for Hard Disk:

Again choose Use an existing virtual hard disk file.

Select same ubuntu-18.04-amd64-disk001.vmdk or duplicate it if needed.

Click Create.

Part 3: Attach Both VMs to NAT Network
4. Set Network for VM1 and VM2
For both VMs:

Select the VM â†’ Click Settings â†’ Network.

Under Adapter 1:

Check Enable Network Adapter.

Attached to: NAT Network.

Name: Select your NATNetwork.

Save.

âœ… Now VM1 and VM2 are connected in the same private network.

Part 4: Start VMs and Setup IP Addresses
5. Start VM1 and VM2
Start both VM1 and VM2.

Login with username and password (check with your sir if required).

6. Find their IP addresses
Inside both VMs, open a terminal and type:

ip a
Look for an IP address like 10.0.2.15 or similar under enp0s3 or eth0.
Example:

VM1 IP: 10.0.2.4

VM2 IP: 10.0.2.5

ðŸ“Œ Note down their IPs!

Part 5: Install OpenSSH Server
(So they can communicate)

7. Install SSH server on both VMs
In VM1 and VM2, run:

sudo apt update
sudo apt install openssh-server
âœ… This allows them to send files using scp.

Part 6: Share a .txt File
8. Create a .txt file on VM1
In VM1 terminal:

echo "Hello from VM1!" > myfile.txt
Now, you have myfile.txt ready in VM1.

9. Transfer file from VM1 to VM2 using scp
In VM1 terminal, type:

scp myfile.txt username@<VM2-IP>:/home/username/
Replace:

username â†’ your username in VM2.

<VM2-IP> â†’ the IP address of VM2 (like 10.0.2.5).

Example:

scp myfile.txt student@10.0.2.5:/home/student/
It will ask for VM2's password â†’ Enter it.

âœ… After successful transfer, file will appear in /home/username/ of VM2!

Part 7: Verify
In VM2, check the file:

ls
cat myfile.txt

You should see:

Hello from VM1!
