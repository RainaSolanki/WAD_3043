Step 1: Install Node.js and npm
Angular requires Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager).

Download and install from https://nodejs.org

Verify installation:

node -v
npm -v

Step 2: Install Angular CLI (Command Line Interface)
Open the terminal in VS Code and run:

npm install -g @angular/cli
Verify Angular CLI installation:

ng version

Step 3: Create a New Angular App
In the terminal, run:

ng new my-angular-app
Use the arrow keys to select options like routing or stylesheet format (CSS, SCSS, etc.)

Navigate to the created folder:

cd my-angular-app

Step 4: Open the Project in VS Code
If youâ€™re not already inside VS Code, open the folder using:

code .

Run npm install
Open VS Code Terminal in the root of your Angular project (in your case, D:\3026\angular).

Run:
npm install


Step 5: Run the Angular Application
Start the development server:

ng serve
or
ng serve --open

This will compile the app and open it in your default browser at http://localhost:4200

Step 6: Edit and Develop
Modify files inside the src/app/ directory (like app.component.ts, app.component.html) to update your app.

The app auto-reloads when you save changes.
